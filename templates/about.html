<!-- Read More Content for History Section (Initially Hidden) -->
<div id="readMoreContent" class="read-more-content" style="display: none;">
    <p>He was the Hassan District Commissioner then. The Coffee Planters around and other local farmers and many others contributed financially to make this college a reality.</p>
    <p>Mr. Chandappa Patil was a gentleman of humble origins. He was the first graduate from his village and had a vision to bring education to the masses in Karnataka, however remote the place was.</p>
    <p>This was his first venture. He worked very closely with the Late and Ex Vice President of India, Mr. Jatti, to open more educational institutions.</p>
    <p>The college was initially affiliated with the University of Mysore but later changed its affiliation to Visvesvaraya Technological University, Belgaum. In 2007, the college became an autonomous institute.</p>
